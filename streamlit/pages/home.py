Often a major cause of downtime is malfunctioning machines. During downtime, the overhead operating costs keeps growing without a significant increase in productivity. A survey in 2017 had found that 70% of companies cannot estimate when an equipment starts malfunctioning and only realise when itâ€™s too late. If malfunctions can be detected early, downtime costs can be drastically reduced.")

A machine will produce a different acoustic signature in its abnormal state compared to its normal state. Our AI algorithm can detect such different sound signatures with high degree of accuracy and can issue early warnings if indications of hardware malfunctions are detected.")
